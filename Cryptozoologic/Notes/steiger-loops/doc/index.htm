<P>  This piece was originally played using a Yamaha DMP7 or DMP11, which
applied effects and minimal spatialization to the instrumental parts.  In
late 2001 this was reimplemented using Pd for a performance at Cooper Union.

(See also the <a href=../../../doc/index.htm#sect_perform>
general performance instructions </A> .)<P> 

<P> The setup for <I> 13 loops </I> requires 5 microphones (placed close to
the five instruments) and 4 speakers in a rectangle around the audience.
The cues in the patch are simply clicked on by the computer operator.  The
cues should be marked in the score.

<P> There are MIDI inputs for two banks of 8 faders each, which control
direct and "transformed" levels of the five intstruments, and a global
reverb level. These are mirrored on the main page of the patch.

<P> It's possible to play soundfiles of the instrumental performances
through the patch for testing purposes; however, the existing recordings 
can't be distributed here for copyright reasons.
