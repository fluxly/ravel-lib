parameters:

------------ MIDI controllable "global" controls --------------

All have range 0-127.

fl-level, bc-level, pc-level, vn-level, vc-level:  direct amplification.
127 = unit gain.

flfx-level, etc., effects return for flute, etc., 0-127, 127 = unit gain

rev-return reverb return level, 0-127.


------------------ Spatialization ------------------------------------

NOTE: In what follows, the "location" and "spread" parameters may be a
(target, time) pair; the rest are simple numeric controls.

fl-atten, etc.  Input attenuation in dB, 0-100 (100 means "unit gain").

fl-loc, etc:  spatial location, 0-80, with:
    0 - back
    10 - back left speaker (ch. 4)
    20 - left
    30 - front left speaker (ch. 1)
    40 - center stage
    50 - front right speaker (ch. 2)
    60 - right
    70 - right rear speaker (ch. 3)
    80 - back
    
fl-spread, etc:  spread of the "image" from 0 (focussed) to 20 (diffuse).

fl-rev, etc.  Reverb send, dB, 0-100.

flfx-loc., etc.  Spatial location of flute effect return, 10-90 as above

flfx-spread, etc.  Diffusenesss of the effect return.  For MONO effects
(looped delay, flanger) this is as in "fl-spread", etc.; for STEREO effects, 10
means regular stereo separation (45 degrees of left and right of image); 0
means mix to mono and spatialize; and 20 means "spatialize the two channels 90
degrees to left and right of spatial location".

rev-fback. Reverb feedback, AKA reverb time.  0-100.
------------------- Flute effect parameters ---------------------

PITCH SHIFT.  (STEREO)
fl-pshift-switch.  Switch the pitch shifter on and off.

fl-shift1.  Pitch shift of first shifter, in cents up or down.
fl-window1. "Window" size of first shifter, in msec.
fl-delay1. Delay in msec for first shifter.

fl-shift2, fl-window2, fl-delay2, ditto for second pitch shifter.

MULTI DELAY. (QUAD) 

NOTE: spatialization spread here should be 0-30.

fl-multitap-switch.  Switch it on and off.
fl-del1, ..., fl-del4.  Delay times in msec.

LOOP DELAY. (MONO)

fl-loopdel-switch.  Switch it on and off.
fl-del1.  Delay time in msec.
fl-fback.  Feedback, percent, 0-100.

------------------- Bass Clarinet effect parameters ---------------------

FLANGER.
bc-flanger-switch.  Switch it on and off.
bc-fdel. Flanger delay range, msec.
bc-speed, Flanger oscillation speed, hundredths of a Hz.
bc-fback.  Flanger fake feedback (there are only 9 discrete echos.)


MAYBE LATER:
Input attenuations (for "soloing" and dropping gains for processing?)
